This web application allows me to host my text files as a blog on a website.  

0)  I can log into it.

1)  It is able to check github to see if I have updated my text file.  

2)  It is able to parse my personal ascii syntax and convert it into html elements which are styled to look absolutely magnificent.  

3)  It is able to allow comments and users other than myself to host their scrolls on my site if they so choose to.
